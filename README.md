# Clasp for Google Apps Scripts

[clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp) lets us develop Google Apps Scripts locally with version control, unit tests, etc. We can push up changes to the script with `clasp push` and pull changes down with `clasp pull`. (After a `clasp login` to ensure you have access to the script)
